**Step 1:** Independent and combined sufficiency: test I alone, II alone, then I+II to see whether only the combination gives a unique answer. 

**Step 2:** Evaluate the question using statement I alone, statement II alone, and then both statements together. 

**Step 3:** From statement I alone, the possible outcomes are {18, 21, 24}. From statement II alone, the possible outcomes are {18, 24}. 

**Step 4:** Using both statements gives outcomes {18, 24}, which still contain more than one possibi

**Step 1:** Square/cube-based series: look for squares, cubes, or combinations (n², n³, ± constants) in the terms. 

**Step 2:** List the terms and compute differences/ratios (or powers) as needed to spot the rule. 

**Step 3:** The series follows the pattern n²±1 with n increasing by 1: terms are built from consecutive integers. 

**Step 4:** For n = 9, the term becomes 82, so 82 is the only value that fits the n²/n³±1 pattern. 

**Step 5:** Conclude: Therefore, the correct answer is 82.

**Step 1:** Traditional syllogism: treat each statement as an 'all / some / no' relation and test each conclusion with standard rules. 

**Step 2:** Combine the statements logically (or via a quick Venn/sketch) to see all forced and possible relations. 

**Step 3:** From 'All students are teachers' and 'Some teachers are doctors', we only know that students is inside teachers and that teachers overlaps doctors; it is possible that the overlap between teachers and doctors contains no students at

**Step 1:** Mixed ranking problems: combine different ranking clues (positions, comparisons) to locate the target rank or person. 

**Step 2:** Write down the given positions or comparisons systematically instead of keeping them in mind. 

**Step 3:** Convert Sneha's position from the right (5) to position from the left: pos(Sneha) from left = 18 – 5 + 1 = 14. Then the gap between them is |14 – 6| – 1. 

**Step 4:** Compute |14 – 6| – 1 = 7, so there are 7 persons between Amit and Sneha, matchin
