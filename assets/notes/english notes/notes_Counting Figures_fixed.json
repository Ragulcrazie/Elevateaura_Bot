{"topic":"Counting Figures","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine you are looking at a complex diagram made of many lines, shapes, or patterns, and you are asked to count how many triangles, squares, or other figures are hidden within it. Counting figures questions test your ability to systematically identify and count all possible shapes in a given diagram.","2_definitions":["💡 Counting Figures: The process of finding the total number of specific shapes (like triangles, squares, rectangles, etc.) in a given diagram.","💡 Overlapping Figures: Shapes that share some lines or areas with other shapes.","💡 Hidden Figures: Shapes that are not immediately obvious and may be formed by combining smaller shapes.","💡 Composite Figure: A figure made up of two or more simple shapes.","💡 Systematic Counting: Counting in a logical order to avoid missing or double-counting shapes.","💡 Symmetry: When a figure can be divided into parts that are mirror images.","💡 Grid: A network of lines that cross each other to form squares or rectangles.","💡 Layer: A level or tier in a complex figure, often used in pyramids or stacked shapes.","💡 Sub-Figure: A smaller figure that is part of a larger figure.","💡 Trap: A common mistake or pitfall in counting figures."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. Count all the smallest shapes first (e.g., smallest triangles).","🧮 2. Look for shapes formed by combining two or more smaller shapes.","🧮 3. Use symmetry to identify repeating patterns.","🧮 4. Mark counted shapes lightly to avoid double-counting.","🧮 5. Count shapes layer by layer in complex figures.","🧮 6. For grids, use formulas: Number of squares in n x n grid = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.","🧮 7. For triangles in a triangle, use: n(n+1)/2, where n is the number of divisions on a side.","🧮 8. For rectangles in a grid: n(n+1)m(m+1)/4, where n and m are rows and columns.","🧮 9. Practice with different types of figures to improve speed.","🧮 10. Review previous year questions for common patterns.","🧮 11. Use elimination to rule out impossible shapes.","🧮 12. Check for overlapping and hidden figures.","🧮 13. Count each type of shape separately.","🧮 14. Use color coding if allowed to track counted shapes.","🧮 15.
