{"topic":"Mirror Images","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine looking at yourself in a mirror. Your left hand appears as the right hand in the reflection. In exams, mirror image questions test your ability to visualize how an object, number, or word would look if placed in front of a mirror, usually along a vertical or horizontal axis.","2_definitions":["💡 Mirror Image: The reflection of an object as seen in a mirror.","💡 Vertical Mirror: A mirror placed upright, causing left-right reversal.","💡 Horizontal Mirror: A mirror placed flat, causing top-bottom reversal.","💡 Lateral Inversion: The phenomenon where left and right are reversed in a mirror image.","💡 Axis of Reflection: The line along which the mirror is placed.","💡 Symmetry: When one half of an object is a mirror image of the other half.","💡 Original Figure: The actual object before reflection.","💡 Reflected Figure: The image formed after reflection."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 No strict formulas, but use logical steps:","🧮 1. Identify the axis of the mirror (vertical or horizontal).","🧮 2. For vertical mirrors, swap left and right.","🧮 3. For horizontal mirrors, swap top and bottom.","🧮 4. Numbers and letters may appear reversed.","🧮 5. Symmetrical figures look the same in the mirror.","🧮 6. Draw the reflection if unsure.","🧮 7. Use elimination for confusing options.","🧮 8.
