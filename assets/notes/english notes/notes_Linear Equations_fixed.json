If the total bill is Rs. 600 and you and your friend pay equal amounts, you can use a linear equation to find out how much each should pay. Linear equations help solve real-life problems where relationships are straight and direct, just like in many exam questions.","2_definitions":["💡 Linear Equation: An equation of the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are constants and x is a variable.","💡 Variable: A symbol representing an unknown value.","💡 Constant: A fixed value in the equation.","💡 Coefficient: The number multiplying the variable.","💡 Solution: The value of the variable that satisfies the equation.","💡 Simultaneous Equations: Two or more linear equations solved together.","💡 System of Equations: A set of equations with the same variables.","💡 Graph: A visual representation of equations.","💡 Slope: The steepness of a line (m in y = mx + c).","💡 Intercept: The point where the line crosses the axis."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 ax + b = 0 ⇒ x = -b/a","🧮 y = mx + c (slope-intercept form)","🧮 m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) (slope formula)","🧮 To solve: ax + by = c, dx + ey = f","🧮 x = (ce - bf) / (ae - bd)","🧮 y = (af - cd) / (ae - bd)","🧮 If a1/a2 ≠ b1/b2, lines intersect (unique solution)","🧮 If a1/a2 = b1/b2 ≠ c1/c2, lines are parallel (no solution)","🧮 If a1/a2 = b1/b2 = c1/c2, lines coincide (infinite solutions)","🧮 Sum of roots: -b/a (for ax + b = 0)","🧮 Product of roots: Not applicable for linear equations","🧮 Elimination method: Add/subtract equations to eliminate a variable.","🧮 Substitution method: Substitute value from one equation into another.","🧮 Cross-multiplication method for two variables.","🧮 Graphical solution: Intersection point of lines."],"4_micro_examples":["If x + 5 = 12, x = 7.","If 2x = 10, x = 5.","If 3x - 9 = 0, x = 3.","If x/4 = 3, x = 12.","If 5x + 2 = 17, x = 3.","If x - 8 = 4, x = 12.","If 7x = 21, x = 3.","If x + y = 10, y = 6, x = 4.","If 2x - y = 8, x = 5, y = 2.","If x - y = 2, x = 7, y = 5."],"5_exam_examples":[{"question":"Solve: 2x + 3 = 11","solution_steps":["2x + 3 = 11","2x = 8","x = 4"],"answer":"4"},{"question":"If x - 7 = 5, find x.","solution_steps":["x - 7 = 5","x = 12"],"answer":"12"},{"question":"If 3x = 18, what is x?","solution_steps":["3x = 18","x = 6"],"answer":"6"},{"question":"If x/2 = 9, find x.","solution_steps":["x/2 = 9","x = 18"],"answer":"18"},{"question":"If 4x - 8 = 0, find x.","solution_steps":["4x - 8 = 0","4x = 8","x = 2"],"answer":"2"},{"question":"If x + y = 15, y = 9, find x.","solution_steps":["x + 9 = 15","x = 6"],"answer":"6"},{"question":"If 2x + 3y = 12, x = 2, find y.","solution_steps":["2*2 + 3y = 12","4 + 3y = 12","3y = 8","y = 2.67"],"answer":"2.67"},{"question":"If x^2 - 9x = 0, find x.","solution_steps":["x(x - 9) = 0","x = 0 or 9"],"answer":"0, 9"},{"question":"If x - 3 = 2x - 7, find x.","solution_steps":["x - 3 = 2x - 7","-3 + 7 = 2x - x","4 = x"],"answer":"4"},{"question":"If x + y = 12, x - y = 4, find x and y.","solution_steps":["x + y = 12","x - y = 4","Add: 2x = 16, x = 8","y = 4"],"answer":"x = 8, y = 4"},{"question":"If 5x + 10 = 35, find x.","solution_steps":["5x + 10 = 35","5x = 25","x = 5"],"answer":"5"},{"question":"If 2x + 3 = 7, find x.","solution_steps":["2x + 3 = 7","2x = 4","x = 2"],"answer":"2"}],"6_shortcuts":["⚡ Transpose terms to the other side.","⚡ Divide both sides to isolate the variable.","⚡ Combine like terms before solving.","⚡ Use elimination for simultaneous equations.","⚡ Use substitution for quick solutions.","⚡ Check by substituting the answer back.","⚡ For x + y and x - y, add/subtract equations.","⚡ Remember slope-intercept form for graphs.","⚡ If coefficients are equal, subtract equations.","⚡ Multiply equations to align coefficients.","⚡ For fractions, multiply both sides by denominator.","⚡ Always simplify before solving.","⚡ Use cross-multiplication for two variables.","⚡ Graph equations for visual solutions.","⚡ Check for unique, no, or infinite solutions."],"7_traps":["⚠️ Forgetting to change sign when moving terms.","⚠️ Dividing by zero (undefined).","⚠️ Not simplifying both sides equally.","⚠️ Ignoring coefficients when isolating variables.","⚠️ Confusing addition and multiplication.","⚠️ Forgetting to check answer in original equation.","⚠️ Mixing up variables in simultaneous equations.","⚠️ Not factoring completely.","⚠️ Assuming all equations have real solutions.","⚠️ Missing negative solutions in squares."],"8_case_study":{"scenario":"🧑‍🎓 A shopkeeper wants to split Rs. 1200 between two employees so that one gets Rs. x and the other gets Rs.
