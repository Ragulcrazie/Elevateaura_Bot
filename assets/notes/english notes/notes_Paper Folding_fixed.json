{"topic":"Paper Folding","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine folding a piece of paper and cutting shapes into it. When you unfold it, the cuts appear symmetrically on both sides. In exams, paper folding questions test your ability to visualize how folds and cuts translate into patterns when the paper is unfolded.","2_definitions":["💡 Paper Folding: The process of folding a paper and making cuts or marks, then unfolding to see the resulting pattern.","💡 Symmetry: The balanced arrangement of shapes or patterns on both sides of a fold.","💡 Crease: The line formed by folding the paper.","💡 Unfolding: Opening the paper to reveal the full pattern.","💡 Mirror Image: The reflected pattern on the opposite side of the fold.","💡 Axis of Fold: The line along which the paper is folded.","💡 Cut Pattern: The shape or mark made while the paper is folded.","💡 Overlay: The superimposed pattern after unfolding.","💡 Reflection: The process of flipping the pattern across the fold.","💡 Rotation: Turning the paper to view the pattern from different angles."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. Number of symmetrical shapes = Number of folds × 2 (if all folds are along the same axis)","🧮 2. If a cut is made at a distance 'd' from the fold, its image appears at distance 'd' on the other side after unfolding.","🧮 3. For multiple folds, the pattern is reflected across each fold axis.","🧮 4. If paper is folded twice, the number of images = 2^number of folds.","🧮 5. Central cuts appear at the center after unfolding.","🧮 6. Edge cuts appear on both edges after unfolding.","🧮 7. Diagonal folds create diagonal symmetry.","🧮 8. For n folds, maximum images = 2^n.","🧮 9. If a cut is on the fold, it appears only once after unfolding.","🧮 10. For square paper, folds along diagonals create fourfold symmetry.","🧮 11. For rectangular paper, vertical/horizontal folds create twofold symmetry.","🧮 12. If a cut is made at the intersection of folds, it appears at all symmetrical positions.","🧮 13. The number of unique patterns increases with the number of folds.","🧮 14. For circular paper, radial folds create radial symmetry.","🧮 15. The more the folds, the more complex the pattern.","🧮 16. If a fold is not perfect, the symmetry is imperfect.","🧮 17. Patterns are always mirrored across the fold axis.","🧮 18. For odd number of folds, the center line is unique.","🧮 19. For even number of folds, the pattern is balanced.","🧮 20. The position of the cut determines the final pattern."],"4_micro_examples":["Fold once, cut a triangle at the edge.
