{"topic":"Figure Analogy","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine solving a puzzle where you are shown a sequence of shapes, and you must find the next shape that follows the same pattern. In exams, figure analogy questions test your ability to identify relationships between pairs of figures and apply the same logic to find the missing figure.","2_definitions":["💡 Figure Analogy: A type of reasoning where a relationship between two figures is identified and applied to another pair.","💡 Pattern: The specific arrangement or transformation applied to figures.","💡 Transformation: A change such as rotation, reflection, resizing, or shading applied to a figure.","💡 Pairing: Matching two figures based on a logical relationship.","💡 Sequence: An ordered set of figures following a rule.","💡 Similarity: Features that are alike between figures.","💡 Difference: Features that distinguish one figure from another.","💡 Correspondence: The logical link connecting two figures."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 No strict formulas, but use logical steps:","🧮 1. Observe the first pair of figures.","🧮 2. Identify the transformation or relationship.","🧮 3. Apply the same transformation to the next figure.","🧮 4.
