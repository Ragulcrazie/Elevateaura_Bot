{"topic":"Water Images","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine looking at your reflection in a calm pond. Your head appears at the bottom and your feet at the top. In exams, water image questions test your ability to visualize how an object, number, or word would look if reflected in water, usually along a horizontal axis (top-bottom inversion).","2_definitions":["💡 Water Image: The reflection of an object as seen in water, causing top-bottom reversal.","💡 Horizontal Axis: The line along which the water surface lies, causing vertical inversion.","💡 Vertical Axis: The line along which a mirror is placed upright (not used in water images).","💡 Top-Bottom Inversion: The phenomenon where the top and bottom are reversed in a water image.","💡 Symmetry: When one half of an object is a water image of the other half.","💡 Original Figure: The actual object before reflection.","💡 Reflected Figure: The image formed after water reflection.","💡 Inversion: The process of turning upside down."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 No strict formulas, but use logical steps:","🧮 1. Identify the axis of reflection (horizontal for water images).","🧮 2. Swap top and bottom of the figure.","🧮 3. Letters and numbers may appear upside down.","🧮 4. Symmetrical figures look the same in water.","🧮 5. Draw the reflection if unsure.","🧮 6. Use elimination for confusing options.","🧮 7. Practice with different shapes and letters.","🧮 8.
