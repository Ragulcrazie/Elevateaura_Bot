{"topic":"Dice Net & Cube Net","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine cutting open a dice or a cube and laying it flat on a table. The flat shape you see is called a net. In exams, dice net and cube net questions test your ability to visualize how a 2D net folds into a 3D cube and how the faces are arranged.","2_definitions":["💡 Net: A two-dimensional figure that can be folded to form a three-dimensional object like a cube or dice.","💡 Cube Net: A flat arrangement of six squares that can be folded into a cube.","💡 Dice Net: A cube net with numbers or dots on each face, used in games.","💡 Face: One of the flat surfaces of a cube or dice.","💡 Edge: The line where two faces meet.","💡 Vertex: The point where three edges meet.","💡 Adjacent Faces: Faces that share a common edge.","💡 Opposite Faces: Faces that are directly across from each other.","💡 Valid Net: A net that can be folded into a cube without overlap.","💡 Invalid Net: A net that cannot be folded into a cube."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. A cube has 11 distinct valid nets.","🧮 2. A valid net must have all six faces connected in a way that allows folding into a cube.","🧮 3.
