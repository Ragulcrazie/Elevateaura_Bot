{"topic":"Paper Cutting","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine folding a paper and making several cuts. When you unfold it, the cuts create a beautiful, symmetrical pattern. In exams, paper cutting questions test your ability to mentally visualize the final pattern after a series of folds and cuts.","2_definitions":["💡 Paper Cutting: The process of folding paper and making cuts, then unfolding to reveal a pattern.","💡 Symmetry: The balanced arrangement of shapes or patterns on both sides of a fold.","💡 Crease: The line formed by folding the paper.","💡 Unfolding: Opening the paper to see the full pattern.","💡 Cut Pattern: The shape or mark made while the paper is folded.","💡 Overlay: The superimposed pattern after unfolding.","💡 Reflection: The process of flipping the pattern across the fold.","💡 Axis of Fold: The line along which the paper is folded.","💡 Multiple Folds: Folding the paper more than once to increase pattern complexity.","💡 Central Cut: A cut made at the center of the folded paper."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. Number of images = 2^number of folds (if all folds are perpendicular).","🧮 2. A cut at distance 'd' from the fold appears at the same distance on the other side after unfolding.","🧮 3. For n folds, maximum images = 2^n.","🧮 4. Central cuts appear at the center after unfolding.","🧮 5. Edge cuts appear on both edges after unfolding.","🧮 6. Diagonal folds create diagonal symmetry.","🧮 7. For square paper, folds along diagonals create fourfold symmetry.","🧮 8. For rectangular paper, vertical/horizontal folds create twofold symmetry.","🧮 9. If a cut is on the fold, it appears only once after unfolding.","🧮 10. The more the folds, the more complex the pattern.","🧮 11. If a fold is not perfect, the symmetry is imperfect.","🧮 12. Patterns are always mirrored across the fold axis.","🧮 13. For odd number of folds, the center line is unique.","🧮 14. For even number of folds, the pattern is balanced.","🧮 15. The position of the cut determines the final pattern.","🧮 16. If a cut is made at the intersection of folds, it appears at all symmetrical positions.","🧮 17. The number of unique patterns increases with the number of folds.","🧮 18. For circular paper, radial folds create radial symmetry.","🧮 19. Each additional fold doubles the number of images.","🧮 20. The complexity of the pattern increases exponentially with folds."],"4_micro_examples":["Fold once, cut a triangle at the edge. Unfold: 2 triangles.","Fold twice, cut a circle at the corner.
