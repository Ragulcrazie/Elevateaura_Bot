{"topic":"Embedded Figures","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine looking at a complex picture and trying to find a simple shape hidden within it, like finding a triangle inside a star. In exams, embedded figures questions test your ability to spot a given shape hidden within a larger, more complex figure.","2_definitions":["💡 Embedded Figure: A simple shape or pattern hidden within a larger, complex figure.","💡 Complex Figure: A figure made up of multiple lines, shapes, or patterns.","💡 Target Figure: The shape you are asked to find within the complex figure.","💡 Distractor: Extra lines or shapes added to confuse the observer.","💡 Visual Scanning: The process of looking over the entire figure to find the target.","💡 Pattern Recognition: The ability to identify shapes and patterns within a figure.","💡 Rotation: Turning the target figure to match its orientation in the complex figure.","💡 Overlapping: When the target figure shares lines or areas with other shapes.","💡 Partial Match: When only part of the target figure is visible, but not the whole.","💡 Mirror Image: A reversed version of the target figure that may appear in the complex figure."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. Scan the entire figure systematically from left to right and top to bottom.","🧮 2. Compare the target figure with all possible locations in the complex figure.","🧮 3. Rotate the target figure mentally to match different orientations.","🧮 4. Ignore distractor lines and focus on the target shape.","🧮 5. Check for overlapping lines that may hide the target figure.","🧮 6. Use tracing with a finger or pencil to follow the target shape.","🧮 7. Break the complex figure into smaller sections for easier scanning.","🧮 8. Look for unique features of the target figure (e.g., right angles, equal sides).","🧮 9. Eliminate options where the target figure is incomplete.","🧮 10. Practice with different types of embedded figures to improve speed.","🧮 11. Use elimination to rule out figures that do not match.","🧮 12. Check for mirror images or rotated versions of the target.","🧮 13. Focus on the starting point of the target figure.","🧮 14. Use grid lines if available to align the target.","🧮 15. Visualize the target figure in different positions.","🧮 16. Mark found figures lightly to avoid double counting.","🧮 17. Practice with time limits to improve exam speed.","🧮 18. Check for partial matches but confirm the whole figure is present.","🧮 19. Use color coding if allowed to highlight the target.","🧮 20. Review previous year questions for common patterns."],"4_micro_examples":["Find a triangle hidden inside a star.","Spot a square embedded within a hexagon.","Locate a circle inside a flower
