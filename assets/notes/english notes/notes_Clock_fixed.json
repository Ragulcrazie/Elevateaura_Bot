{"topic":"Clock","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine you are trying to figure out when the hour and minute hands of a clock will overlap, or how many degrees apart they are at a certain time. Clock questions test your ability to calculate angles, positions, and relationships between the hands of a clock.","2_definitions":["💡 Clock: An instrument for measuring and displaying time.","💡 Hour Hand: The shorter hand that shows the hour.","💡 Minute Hand: The longer hand that shows the minutes.","💡 Second Hand: The hand that shows the seconds (if present).","💡 Angle: The space between two intersecting lines or surfaces at or close to the point where they meet.","💡 Coincidence: When two hands overlap or are at the same position.","💡 Opposition: When two hands are 180 degrees apart.","💡 Right Angle: When two hands are 90 degrees apart.","💡 Reflex Angle: An angle greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.","💡 Gain/Loss: The amount of time a clock is fast or slow compared to the correct time."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1.
