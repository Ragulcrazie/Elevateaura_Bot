{"topic":"Cube Rotation","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine spinning a Rubik's Cube and watching how the colored faces change positions. In exams, cube rotation questions test your ability to mentally track the movement of faces, edges, and corners as the cube is rotated in different directions.","2_definitions":["💡 Cube: A solid figure with six equal square faces.","💡 Rotation: The act of turning the cube around an axis.","💡 Face: One of the flat surfaces of the cube.","💡 Edge: The line where two faces of a cube meet.","💡 Vertex: The point where three edges meet.","💡 Axis of Rotation: The line around which the cube is turned.","💡 Clockwise Rotation: Turning the cube in the direction of a clock's hands.","💡 Counterclockwise Rotation: Turning the cube opposite to the direction of a clock's hands.","💡 Visible Faces: Faces that can be seen after a rotation.","💡 Hidden Faces: Faces that are not visible after a rotation."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. For a cube, each rotation changes the position of faces, edges, and vertices.","🧮 2. A 90° rotation moves the top face to a side face.","🧮 3. A 180° rotation moves the top face to the bottom.","🧮 4. The number of possible orientations for a cube is 24.","🧮 5. If a cube is rotated about an axis passing through the centers of two opposite faces, those faces remain in place.","🧮 6. If a cube is rotated about an axis passing through the centers of two opposite edges, those edges remain in place.","🧮 7. If a cube is rotated about an axis passing through two opposite vertices, those vertices remain in place.","🧮 8. The arrangement of faces remains consistent after a full 360° rotation.","🧮 9. The sum of numbers on opposite faces of a standard dice is always 7.","🧮 10. If two adjacent faces are known, their opposite faces can be found by subtraction from 7.","🧮 11. The face not visible in two different views is the same.","🧮 12. The face that changes position after rotation can be tracked by following the axis.","🧮 13. The sum of numbers on three adjacent faces is always less than 16.","🧮 14. The sum of numbers on three faces meeting at a vertex is always 9, 10, or 11.","🧮 15. If two cubes are identical except for rotation, their opposite faces remain the same.","🧮 16. If two faces are adjacent in one view, they cannot be opposite.","🧮 17. For a cube, each vertex is shared by 3 faces.","🧮 18. For a cube, each edge is shared by 2 faces.","🧮 19. The number of faces in a cube is 6.","🧮 20.
