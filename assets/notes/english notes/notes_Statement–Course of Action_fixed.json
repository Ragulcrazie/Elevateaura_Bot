{"topic":"Statement–Course of Action","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine a city facing frequent traffic jams. The city council receives a report (statement) about the problem and must decide what steps (course of action) to take. In exams, you are given a statement describing a problem and several possible actions. You must judge which actions are logical, practical, and directly address the problem.","2_definitions":["💡 Statement: A description of a situation, problem, or event.","💡 Course of Action: A step or decision proposed to solve or address the problem in the statement.","💡 Feasible Action: An action that is practical and can be implemented.","💡 Logical Action: An action that directly addresses the root cause of the problem.","💡 Relevant Action: An action that is connected to the statement and not unrelated.","💡 Drastic Action: An extreme step, often not preferred unless necessary.","💡 Preventive Action: Steps taken to avoid the problem in the future.","💡 Remedial Action: Steps taken to solve the problem after it has occurred."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 No strict formulas, but use logical evaluation steps:","🧮 1.
