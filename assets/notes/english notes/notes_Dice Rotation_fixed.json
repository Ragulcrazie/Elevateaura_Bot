{"topic":"Dice Rotation","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine rolling a dice and watching how the numbers change positions as it turns. In exams, dice rotation questions test your ability to mentally track the movement of faces and numbers as the dice is rotated in different directions.","2_definitions":["💡 Dice: A cube with numbers or dots on each face, used in games.","💡 Rotation: The act of turning the dice around an axis.","💡 Face: One of the flat surfaces of the dice.","💡 Adjacent Faces: Faces that share a common edge.","💡 Opposite Faces: Faces that are directly across from each other.","💡 Axis of Rotation: The line around which the dice is turned.","💡 Clockwise Rotation: Turning the dice in the direction of a clock's hands.","💡 Counterclockwise Rotation: Turning the dice opposite to the direction of a clock's hands.","💡 Visible Faces: Faces that can be seen after a rotation.","💡 Hidden Faces: Faces that are not visible after a rotation."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. For a standard dice, sum of opposite faces = 7.","🧮 2. If two adjacent faces are known, their opposite faces can be found by subtraction from 7.","🧮 3. When a dice is rotated, the face on top moves to the side it is rotated towards.","🧮 4. If a dice is rotated 90° clockwise, the top face moves to the right face.","🧮 5. If a dice is rotated 90° counterclockwise, the top face moves to the left face.","🧮 6. If a dice is rotated 180°, the top face moves to the bottom.","🧮 7. The face opposite to the face on top is always at the bottom.","🧮 8. If the front face moves up, the top face moves to the back.","🧮 9. If the right face moves up, the top face moves to the left.","🧮 10. If the left face moves up, the top face moves to the right.","🧮 11. If the back face moves up, the top face moves to the front.","🧮 12. If the bottom face moves up, the top face moves to the top.","🧮 13. The arrangement of faces remains consistent after a full rotation.","🧮 14. The sum of numbers on three adjacent faces is always less than 16.","🧮 15. The sum of numbers on three faces meeting at a vertex is always 9, 10, or 11.","🧮 16. If two dice are identical except for rotation, their opposite faces remain the same.","🧮 17. If two faces are adjacent in one view, they cannot be opposite.","🧮 18. The face not visible in two different views is the same.","🧮 19. The face that changes position after rotation can be tracked by following the axis.","🧮 20. The number of possible orientations for a dice is 24."],"4_micro_examples":["If 1 is on top and dice is rotated right, 1 moves to the right face.","If 2 is on front and dice is rotated up, 2 moves to
