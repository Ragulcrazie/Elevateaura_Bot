{"topic":"Pattern Completion","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine you are looking at a picture with a missing part, like a puzzle with one piece gone. Pattern completion questions test your ability to identify which piece correctly completes the given pattern.","2_definitions":["💡 Pattern: A repeated decorative design or sequence.","💡 Completion: The act of making something whole or finishing it.","💡 Missing Part: The section of the pattern that is not shown and needs to be identified.","💡 Symmetry: When one half of a pattern is a mirror image of the other.","💡 Rotation: Turning a pattern around a central point.","💡 Reflection: Flipping a pattern over a line to create a mirror image.","💡 Sequence: An ordered set of elements that follow a rule.","💡 Distractor: An option that looks similar but does not fit the pattern.","💡 Visual Reasoning: The ability to analyze and solve problems using visual information.","💡 Spatial Awareness: Understanding how shapes fit together in space."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1. Observe the given pattern carefully.","🧮 2. Identify the rule or sequence in the pattern.","🧮 3. Look for symmetry, rotation, or reflection.","🧮 4. Compare each option with the missing part.","🧮 5. Eliminate options that do not fit the pattern.","🧮 6. Check for color, shape, and orientation consistency.","🧮 7. Visualize how the missing part will look when placed.","🧮 8. Use tracing or drawing to test options if allowed.","🧮 9. Practice with different types of patterns (geometric, number, symbol, etc.).","🧮 10. Review previous year questions for common pattern types.","🧮 11. Check for repeating elements or sequences.","🧮 12. Look for unique features in the pattern.","🧮 13.
