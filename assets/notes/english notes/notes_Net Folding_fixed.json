{"topic":"Net Folding","language":"English","sections":{"1_story":"Imagine you have a flat piece of paper with shapes drawn on it. If you fold it along the lines, it forms a 3D object like a cube or a box. Net folding questions test your ability to visualize how a 2D net folds into a 3D shape.","2_definitions":["💡 Net: A two-dimensional pattern that can be folded to form a three-dimensional solid.","💡 Folding: The process of bending the net along the lines to create a 3D object.","💡 Face: A flat surface of a 3D object.","💡 Edge: The line where two faces meet.","💡 Vertex: The point where three or more edges meet.","💡 Adjacent Faces: Faces that share a common edge.","💡 Opposite Faces: Faces that do not touch each other in the folded solid.","💡 Cube Net: A net that can be folded to form a cube.","💡 Invalid Net: A net that cannot be folded to form the required 3D shape.","💡 Visualization: The mental process of imagining the folding of the net."],"3_formula_bank":["🧮 1.
