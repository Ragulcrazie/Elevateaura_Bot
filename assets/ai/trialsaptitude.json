"explanation_en": "Step 1: Understand the Ratio. The problem states the ratio of Cost Price (CP) to Selling Price (SP) is 20 : 21. This means if we assume a common multiplier 'x', the Cost Price is 20x and the Selling Price is 21x.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Profit. Profit (Gain) is calculated by subtracting the Cost Price from the Selling Price. So, Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 21x - 20x = 1x.\n\nStep 3: State the Profit Percentage Formula. To find the gain percent, we use the formula: Profit Percentage = (Total Profit / Cost Price) * 100. It is important to remember that profit percentage is always calculated based on the Cost Price.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values into the formula. Profit Percentage = (1x / 20x) * 100. In this fraction, the 'x' in the numerator and the 'x' in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving us with (1 / 20) * 100.\n\nStep 5: Perform the final calculation. 1/20 of 100 is calculated as 100 divided by 20, which equals 5. Therefore, the gain percentage is 5%.",
